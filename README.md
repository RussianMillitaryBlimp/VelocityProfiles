# VelocityProfiles
Numerical calculations for velocity profiles. Side project, stemming from L.A. Barbara's fantastic lecture [series](https://lorenabarba.com/blog/cfd-python-12-steps-to-navier-stokes/). Probably very inaccurate, but was fun to make. Can do assymetric and symmetric profiles, works on the Prandtl mixing length model.
